## Website

- Development: http://localhost:8000/

## Features

- Search and pin any location on the world map
- Pick an event date (up to 6 months ahead) and Analyze in one click
- Results panel with an at-a-glance condition summary and key metrics
- History panel: Past 7 days breakdown for context at your chosen spot
- Nearby Spots: find better micro‚Äëlocations in a 5‚Äì10 km radius, ranked by weather comfort
- CSV export: download current, historical, and probability summaries in one file
- Smooth onboarding: built‚Äëin tutorial overlay that highlights the main controls
- Modern ‚Äúglass‚Äù styling with subtle motion and responsive layout

## How It Works

1. Frontend (Leaflet + vanilla JS)
   - An interactive map with search, draggable marker, and polished panels (see `frontend/`).
   - A guided tutorial overlay introduces location search, date selection, Analyze, and results.
2. Backend (FastAPI)
   - POST `/weather`: fetches daily time series for NASA variables (POWER first; falls back to climatology or MERRA‚Äë2).
   - POST `/probability/doy`: estimates the chance of exceeding thresholds (e.g., hot, windy, heavy rain) around your selected month/day based on historical observations.
   - GET `/weather-suggestions`: samples nearby coordinates and scores them for comfort (temperature, rain, wind, humidity, pressure), then reverse‚Äëgeocodes names.
   - GET `/geocode` and `/reverse-geocode`: proxy to Nominatim with proper headers.
   - POST `/download.csv`: returns a consolidated CSV export of your session data.
3. NASA variables in use
   - T2M (2‚Äëm temperature, ¬∞C), U10M/V10M (10‚Äëm wind components, m/s), WS10M (wind speed, m/s), PS (surface pressure), QV2M (specific humidity, g/kg), PRECTOTCORR (precipitation, mm/day), RH2M (relative humidity, % when available).

## Running Locally

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   cd /workspaces/planmyfest1/backend && python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
   ```

   Server will run at: http://0.0.0.0:8000

## Usage

1. Open the website and switch to the App.
2. Search for a place or click on the map to drop a pin, then pick your event date.
3. Click Analyze to see a prediction summary and metrics for your selected day.
4. Explore the History tab for the past 7 days and the Nearby Spots tab for higher‚Äëscoring locations.
5. Download CSV for current, historical, and probability data to share with your team.
